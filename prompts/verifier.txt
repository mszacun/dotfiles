Please help me fill in scaffold of verifier class:

This is example:

```python

class Name(Verifier):
    name = "identifier"
    verbose_name = _("verbose name")
    group = OtherGroup
    description = (
        "description"
    )
    preconditions = (
    )

    class ResultClass(class_based_results.OkFailUnknownResult):
        OK = class_based_results.VerifierStatus(message=_("message1"), documentation="")
        FAIL = class_based_results.VerifierStatus(message=_("message2"), documentation="")
        UNKNOWN = class_based_results.VerifierStatus(
            message=_("message3"),
            documentation="",
            is_failing=True,
            parameters=HologramsUnknownExtraParams,
        )
```

Based on information that I will provide You fill in:
* name (this is identifier of verifier, it is written using snake case)
* verbose name (this is human readable name of verifier, it is translated using gettext)
* description (this is longer description of what verifier does and when it is usefull)
* ResultClass - it lists possible result statuses of verifier, each one contains human readable message and documentation that describes when this status can be returned. If status is failing, it set to `is_failing=True`

Verifier that I need will be responsible for:
