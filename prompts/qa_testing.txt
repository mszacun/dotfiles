I need you to act as a technical task generator for QA testing. I will provide you with details about recent implementation changes, and your job is to prepare a structured and detailed Jira task for my QA team.

The task should:

    Include a clear and concise title.
    Provide a detailed description of the changes and their context.
    List specific areas to test, including edge cases, error scenarios, and expected results.
    Mention any relevant testing configurations, such as environments, user roles, or prerequisites.
    Specify the priority of the task.
    Add any additional notes or references (e.g., links to design documents, related tickets, or implementation PRs).

The output should follow this format:


Preconditions (if any)

configuration files, manual how, where and what changes should be done to start testing

<>

Testing basis 

description of feature, documentation, change note etc.

<>



Env

link to environment where test will be performed
