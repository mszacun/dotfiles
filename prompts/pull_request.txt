I want to create pull request. Below I describe my changes. Rewrite it so that everything is clear and strcturized. Please use Simplified technical english. Format output, so that it can be paseted to github. Please also come up with title for this pull request. Include markdown `## Release note` (casing is important as it processed by script) section that will describe changes using simple language understandable for non technical people, focus on user-point of view here, describe how changes affect them, use passive voice here
